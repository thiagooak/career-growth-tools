# Delegate work

<!--
One of the things I don't like about many, possibly most business books
is that they will drop the name of another book or website or blogpost and kind
of expect me to do the footwork. I bought the book to pay *you* to do the footwork,
to tell we what Dr. Alic Smith is saying about management and put your won spin
on it. Again, I understand this is just an outline, and this is just me saying
"Don't fall into that trap."

_Something nice here_

* Delegating work is not only for managers
* Delegation is not like a on-off switch it is a continuum (management 3.0 scale)

Management 3.0 sells a deck of [Delegation Poker Cards](https://management30.com/shop/delegation-poker-cards/)
and they are a great illustration of how delegation is not a boolean.

The scale they propose goes from:

1. Tell
2. Sell
3. Consult
4. Agree
5. Advise
6. Inquire
7. Delegate
