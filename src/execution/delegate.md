# Learn to delegate work

_Something nice here_

* Delegating work is not only for managers
* Delegation is not like a on-off switch it is a continuum (management 3.0 scale)

Management 3.0 sells a deck of [Delegation Poker Cards](https://management30.com/shop/delegation-poker-cards/)
and they are a great illustration of how delegation is not a boolean.

The scale they propose goes from:

1. Tell
2. Sell
3. Consult
4. Agree
5. Advise
6. Inquire
7. Delegate
