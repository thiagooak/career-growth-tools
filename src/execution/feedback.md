# Handle critical feedback

<!--
So I really like this section. I think you could add something about recognizing
the difference between feedback, even feedback that is delivered in a hostile
manner and an actual attack (which do happen, just not as often as it feels).
You might also suggest that if they do decide the feedback is unjustified, keep
a record of it anyway and compare it to future feedback. If you think I'm a
loudmouthed jerk that is one thing. If five more people think so, that is
something else.

Feedback is a gift, it can encourage you to do more of what's working
and can help you correct what's not working so well.

Critical feedback is hard to process, even when you it is well delivered and comes from someone you respect.
There is no guarantee that these conditions will be true of the feedback you receive.
So, how can you make the most of the critical feedback that you disagree with and that is poorly delivered,
possibly by someone you are not a huge fan of?

In most cases, you don't need to react to the merits of feedback right away.
It can be helful to to thank the person for the feedback,
let them know that you need some time to think about it and that later you'll reach out to talk more about it.

If when you start listening to the feedback you notice that you are inclined to disagree,
it is a good sign you should pay close attention to what is said.
Even if after reflection you conclude that you disagree with the feedback,
it is still helpful to try and understand why this person has this perception of you.
Is it possible that you come across that way to others? Could this be a blind spot?

In addition to perception look for what is true in the feedback, maybe you disagree with the conclusion
but there are other points that are valid, can you take something useful and constructive from it?

Trying to separate the essence of who you are from what you did can be helpful also.
Maybe the person told you that you are rude. And that sounds like a statement about the essence of who you are. Hard to swallow.
Maybe what the person meant to say was that you acted rudely in situation X. Much easier to deal with this

Make an honest effort to listen and find something useful in the feedback you received.
Talk to people you trust and who know you well, create a safe space for them to be honest with you,
and you may find out that there was more to that critical feedback than you thought.
