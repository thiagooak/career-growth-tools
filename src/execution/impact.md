# Deliver value sooner

<!--
"What difference does it make if we deliver in April or Sept?"
Me: "More than all of your annual salaries."

I think you need to flesh this out a bit, talk about the costs of switching tasks
versus the opportunity costs of delaying C until you finish A or B. My favorite
sentence here is "It depends."

_Identify high-impact projects and focus on them_

Imagine that you have three projects on your plate. Projects A, B, and C,
they are unrelated but similar in size and priority so you decide to equally
divide your time between them.

This works well, you are working on Project A and hit a roadblock, you need to
wait for information or validation from another person or team,
so you change your focus to Project B. You make some progress but eventually you
are stuck again, naturally you change your focus to Project C. You make some
progress and the day is over. You made progress on all of your projects and
you got unstuck by changing you focus, that felt
productive!

Was it really productive?

It depends. The big variable we need to think about here is Opportunity cost.
Opportunity cost is what you give up when you choose to do one thing
instead of another. Any time you dedicate to Projects B and C is
effectively delaying Project A. But the important bit is not necessarily that
it delays the completion of Project A, but that it delays the delivery of the
value we expect from Project A.
