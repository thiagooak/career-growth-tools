# Learn fast


<!--
Possibly relatable story: As a software engineer I listened to other
SW engineers talk about how SW is much hard than other engineering disciplines,
the two most common examples being building a car or a bridge. So here are
expert programmers talking about how easy some other field is, because, of course,
they know nothing about it.

The four stages of competence is an interesting model to think about learning. The four stages are:

1. Unconscious incompetence
2. Conscious incompetence
3. Conscious competence
4. Unconscious competence

For example, if you don't know how to and never really tried to drive a car.

Unconscious incompetence would probably be you thinking that it is quite simple, you look at other people driving so effortlessly, how hard can it be?

Conscious incompetence would probably follow your first driving lesson. There is so much to pay attention to! Super hard to actually drive a car!

Conscious competence would probably be you after passing your driving test. You can do it! But turn down the radio please, I gotta focus.

Unconscious competence looks like an experienced driver changing gears instinctively while singing along to the song in the radio.

* Deliberate practice
* Problem based learning
