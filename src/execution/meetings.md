# Run awesome meetings

_Have a clear goal and don't be the only one talking_

It is easy to complain about meetings, but well run meetings give us essential information and feelings of inclusion, support, voice, and community.

A bad meeting usually includes one of these anti-patterns:

* The meeting does not have a clear goal
* One person, usually the one who called the meeting, is doing most of the talking
* The agenda is not relevant to everyone
* People don't feel safe enough to contribute
* No one is actively facilitating the meeting

* Fixing a broken meeting -->
