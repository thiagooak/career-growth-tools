# Run good meetings

<!--
I realize this is just an outline, but one thing that caught my eye is
that it might be ok for the person who is running the meeting to do most of
the talking: If the purpose is for me to tell you about the latest shark
attack in the lobby or whatever.

_Have a clear goal and don't be the only one talking_

It is easy to complain about meetings, but well run meetings give us essential information and feelings of inclusion, support, voice, and community.

A bad meeting usually includes one of these anti-patterns:

* The meeting does not have a clear goal
* One person, usually the one who called the meeting, is doing most of the talking
* The agenda is not relevant to everyone
* People don't feel safe enough to contribute
* No one is actively facilitating the meeting

<!-- * It is easy to complain about meetings, but great meetings are really great
* Anatomy of an awesome meeting
* Fixing a broken meeting -->
