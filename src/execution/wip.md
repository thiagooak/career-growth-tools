Maybe tell them what they should be doing instead of starting by telling them
what they are doing wrong. Maybe _start_ with something like:

  Remember when you were early in your career? Chances are you were assigned
  a single task and you worked on that task until it was done. And then you
  got another...

  It turns out that is still a great way to work...

Something like that.

How many projects are working on right now? If your answer is any number
greater than one, have you considered the cost involved in splitting
your attention?

Earlier in your career you are more likely to be working on well defined tasks
where you focus on execution. Someone already spent time thinking about
priorities and sequencing so it pays off to grab a lot of tasks and complete
them as fast as you can.

Later in your career, your work becomes more
strategic. You are now one of the people
thinking about priorities and sequencing. Getting priorities wrong can be
expensive. Think about it, moving fast in the wrong direction is worse than moving slowly in the wrong direction.

It is important that you spend a
healthy amount of time thinking. If you are grabbing more and more work
to complete, it is unlikely that you'll have time to even contemplate the
possibility that you may be moving in the wrong direction.

Should your main
project to occupy 100% of your time? 80%? 60%?
Getting to an exact number
is not the goal. The goal is to be intentional about how you allocate your time.
Start by avoiding the anti-pattern of having your
time so fragmented that you find yourself
working on 8 different projects and making little progress in
all of them.

@TODO Talk about Little's Law using a practical example
@TODO Add exercises

Little's Law is a concept from queuing theory that can help you think about
healthy levels of work in progress.

```latexmath
\text{Cycle Time} = \frac{\text{Work in Progress}}{\text{Throughput}}
```

Where:

- Cycle Time is the average time it takes to complete a tasks
- Work in Progress is the average count of tasks in progress
- Throughput is the average amount of tasks done in a certain amount of time



Note that Little's Law doesn't work for making predictions about how many tasks
you will deliver in the future, but it can be used to understand the past.
What has happened to your Throughput when you had different levels of
Work in Progress? Is there an ideal Work in Progress level for you?
In general, you'll find that lower Work in Progress translates into more
Throughput.
