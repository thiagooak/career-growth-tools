# Communicate to be understood

_“The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place” - George Bernard Shaw_

* think about what your audience finds important
* if possible, talk about what's important for you from the perspective of what's important for your audience
* cover knowledge gaps, try not to assume knowledge

Workshop

* Write down a paragraph describing your profession or a project.
* Rewrite it assuming different audiences (a 5-year-old, a teenager, someone who works on another industry, a peer, your mom, etc.)
