# Give feedback

_"Observation of a behavior + Impact of behavior + Question = Actionable, specific feedback that has a chance of landing" - Lara Hogan_

Love this, but make sure you do the footwork on this as well. As an
aside, when you flesh this out, consider if the sections really help? Sometimes
people break their writing up into sections and it just interrupts the flow.

The [feedback equation](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/) is a tool you can use to deliver feedback while maximizing the chance of it being understood.

You break your feedback into three parts

* Observation
* Impact
* Question
For example, image that someone is often late to the a daily meeting with the team.

## Observation
Objective facts that both of you can agree on. This is the foundation of your feedback. Be specific.

I noticed that last week you were more than 10 minutes late to 4 of the 5 meetings we had.

## Impact
Your subjective opinion on the impact of the facts agreed on previously.

When you are this late, this often, the team may feel like you don't respect their time.

## Question
Before you go and try to solve the problem, try to learn more about the context. Be curious and assume good intentions.

Is there anything keeping you from been on time?

This is your chance to present your self as a partner who also wants to solve the problem.

P.S. In this made-up story the person was late because the meeting was close to the time where they had to pick up their kids from school. The solution was rescheduling the meeting to 30 min later.
