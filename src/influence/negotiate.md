# Negotiate like a professional

<!--
I think the secret of negotiation is to 1) know what your bottom line is.
What is the price that I would pay for this house where it would make no
difference to me if I bought the house at that price or walked away. You
certainly don't want to pay more than that price. Item 2) is having an idea
of what that don't care point it for the other person.

_Something nice here_

* Do you homework
* Get to no
* Not you against the other, collaborate, be firm about your non-negotiables
