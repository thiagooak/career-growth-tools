# Create a personal learning network

_A network of people you connect with to support your learning_

<!-- Hook -->
Imagine having the best manager in the world.
When needed, they get their hands dirty and help in task execution.
They are available, are great listeners, and always have the right advice.
They are respected and influential in your company and your industry.
They set you up for success.

No manager could do all that, right?
That is the point of the personal learning network (or PLN).
Even if you have an excellent manager, they will not be perfect,
so create a network of people that complement the support you already have.

<!-- Tool -->
* Create a list of things you want to get better at
* Map people that are good at each thing you want to get better at
* Reach out to them, would they be interested in meeting for coffee once a month? Do they have a ted talk or book you could read.

| I want to learn    | Person I can ask for help |
| -------- | ------- |
| x  | person a    |
| y  | person b    |
| z  | person c    |

* consume
* create
* connect
* contribute

<!-- Evidence -->
<!-- Story -->

<!-- Often your manager has more experience than you. In some cases it has been so long since they were in a situation similar to yours that some of their advice will be outdated or incomplete.

If you are taking a new role, talk to a people who have made the same transition recently (6 to 12 months ago). Their insights will likely be more detailed and better adapted to your context.

Do connect with people in different career stages, different backgrounds, and different strengths. -->
