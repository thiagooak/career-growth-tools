# Mentor Voltron

_Something nice here_

Often your manager has more experience than you. In some cases it has been so long since they were in a situation similar to yours that some of their advice will be outdated or incomplete.

If you are taking a new role, talk to a people who have made the same transition recently (6 to 12 months ago). Their insights will likely be more detailed and better adapted to your context.

Do connect with people in different career stages, different backgrounds, and different strengths.

One great tool to expand your support network is Lara Hogan's [Manager Voltron](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-voltron/).
