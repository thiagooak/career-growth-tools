# Vulnerable feedback

_How do I give someone feedback when what I want to say is too subjective?_

Let's split feedback into two categories: safe feedback and vulnerable feedback.

Safe feedback you can share with confidence. You did your homework, collected the facts, employed empathy, structured the message (see Chapter TBD), and you are ready to deliver it effectively. For the most part, it feels safe.

For example:
> "You seemed a little off during the stand-up today. Are you ok? […] I'm sorry you are going through that […] still, it does not give you a license to raise your voice when talking to the team." - Can you hear the confidence?

Vulnerable feedback is not that confident. You prepared, but it still feels subjective and full of question marks. Vulnerable feedback is uncomfortable. You feel that something is off, but you can't put your finger on it. You want to be fair and objective, but you can't seem to get all the information you need.

Sometimes, the person who can answer your questions is the same person you want to deliver feedback to. It can be tricky to get the information you are missing without sharing at least part of your subjective feedback.

For example:
> "We've been working together for almost a year now, and for some reason, I still don't feel like I really trust you. I know this sounds harsh. I'm sharing because I really want to build more trust between us. Do you feel the same? What could we do to improve the situation?" - Not much confidence here.

The example above is from an actual conversation I had with my boss. It could have been a disaster, but sharing this vulnerable feedback led to a long conversation about communication styles, and it dramatically improved our work relationship.

You can use the following formula to structure your vulnerable feedback:

```latexmath
\text{Vulnerable Feedback} = \text{Intent} + \text{Obstacle} + \text{Invitation}
```

Applying it to the example above, we have:

* Intent: "I really want to build more trust between us"
* Obstacle: "for some reason, I still don't feel like I really trust you"
* Invitation: "Do you feel the same? What could we do to improve the situation?"

Vulnerable feedback is not primarily about the truth. It is primarily about strengthening relationships.

It is not:

> "I know the truth, and I'll share it with you so you can improve."

It looks more like:

> "Hey, here is something I've been thinking about. I'm not sure if there is truth here, but I think it might be useful to you. I'm sharing this as-is because I don't want to deprive you of the chance to learn from it. I also think I can learn something by sharing this with you."

I shared a positive example above, where I told my boss I didn't trust them and somehow did not get fired! It could have completely soured my relationship with my boss. If you plan to use this tool, keep in mind that you probably should not go around sharing subjective feedback as soon as it forms in your mind. This tool requires reflection and preparation. First write your feedback down, maybe use the formula above, test the delivery with a trusted friend, sleep on it, and only then share the feedback.

It is also ok to think about it and choose not to share some vulnerable feedback. But if you never share it, you could miss out on significant improvements in the quality of your work relationships.
