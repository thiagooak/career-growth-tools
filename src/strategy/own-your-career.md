# Own your career development

<!--
I also think this would be the moment to step back and talk about how you
are Thiago Inc. That your goals and your company's goals are not always the
same and that successful people are consciously balancing their own needs
against those of the company and the people they work for. I really like this
section.

career growth._

What are your career goals? What are your company's goals? How much do they overlap?

Do not assign all of the responsibility for your career growth to your Manager.

Popular management wisdom says that "people don't leave jobs, they leave
managers." I'm not sure if there is scientific evidence to back this claim but
it sure resonates with most people who had a bad manager.

I had a bad manager that would respond to team chats during our one-on-one
meetings, all the while pretending to be writing notes. He would ask questions
that I had just answered minutes prior. Once, he even came up with a great idea
that I shared with him a couple of months before. Not exactly someone deeply
invested in helping me grow.

Even if you manager is not _that_ bad, it can be hard to know what excellent
management looks like if you have never seen a great manager in action.

Managers can be excellent partners in the development of your career.
They can advocate for you in the internal bureaucracy around promotions and raises.
They can give you timely and constructive feedback.
They can assign interesting, complex, or high-visibility projects to you.
Still, don't take for granted that they will be great partners in helping
you grow in your career.

I'm not giving managers a pass on helping the people in their teams grow.
A critical part of excellent management _is_ helping people grow.
If you notice that your manager is not that invested, ask them to step up.
You may learn some uncomfortable truths about how they evaluate the quality of
your work or your career growth potential, but this conversation may remove
some guess work and give you concrete areas for improvement.

For example, I tend to match the effort of people I lead.
You are super committed? Great, me too! You are only a little committed? Me too!
Before you accuse me of management malpractice: at first, if you are not
committed I'll try to figure out the source of the issue and see if we can work
together to improve it, but if it continues after many attempts and some clear
feedback, I'll definitely match your effort.

Keep in mind that most managers enjoy promoting people. It takes work off of
their plate and it creates space for them to grow. Besides the fact that telling
someone they are being promoted is one of the best conversations to have.

If you have a bad manager, try to have an honest conversation and see if the
situation improves, if it doesn't consider changing teams or companies.

If you have an excellent manager, it is still a good investment to put in the
work yourself and not expect that your manger will figure it out for you.

In any case, you should be the person devoting the most time, effort, and
energy into your career growth.
