# Set career goals

Defining a career goal can be hard. Your goal doesn’t have to be written in stone, you can change your mind and you can think of intermediate goals. Maybe your goal is to define a long-term career goal! That’s fine, as long as you have a due date.

If you are struggling to define your goal, think of a question you’d need to answer in order to be one step closer to it. Give yourself enough time to think, maybe event talk about your question with people you trust. Repeat this process a few times and you should make some progress.

Once you have a goal, write it down and set reminders to review it.

It is easy to forget that thinking is part of our jobs. Not only thinking about how to complete the task at hand, it also includes thinking about our careers and our professional growth. After all if you become a better professional, your company will also benefit from the improvement.

If you can afford it, a full day of thinking per quarter can be helpful. If not, take the amount of time you can or plug into one of the existing rituals of your company (for example, treat the performance review cycle as your think day.)

I use a variation of [this list](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/your-professional-growth-questionnaire/) of questions to guide my thinking.
